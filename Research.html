		<h1>Banerjee Lab Research Projects</h1> <!-- Background on islets -->
		<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 50px;">Our lab's research focuses on the Islets of Langerhans, housed within the pancreas. In healthy individuals, these spherical mini-organs sense fluctuating blood glucose levels and secrete insulin to couter high glucose. However, in people with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes (T1D/T2D), insulin secretion is either decreased or lost altogether, and the islets are unable to perform their vital physiological role. Our lab takes different approaches to engineering these islets for research and translatable purposes. </p>

			<p class="text" style="padding-top: 0px;"> Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) are adult cells (such as muscle or fat cells) that are converted into cells with stem cell-like properties. iPSCs are able to turn into nearly any other cell type in the body through a process called differentiation. Differentiating iPS cells involves manipulating the chemical and biophysical environment they are exposed to, which alters the cells' gene and protein expression. In our lab, we encapsulate iPSCs in a hydrogel called alginate, exposing the iPSCs to a 3D environment, combined with molecular growth factors to convert the cells into islet-mimetic cells. These iPSC-derived islets provide a large-scale source of cells that can be used for further research or transplantation.</p>

			<p class="text_right" style="padding-top: 0px"> An organ-on-a-chip combines a miniature model organ system with a microfluidic device to better recreate the native environment in the human body. This allows for improved studies of the organ system and streamlined drug testing. Our islet-on-a-chip provides a culture platform for islets that is highly adjustable for various experiments. With it, we are able to culture functional islets for up to one month, while islets in traditional culture methods usually remain viable for one week. This greatly improves the ability to study T2D development in vitro.</p>

		<!-- Bioprinting -->
		<h3 class="headings">Bioprinting </h3>
		<div class="bios_single">
			<img src="img/bioprint.jpg" alt="" class="image_single">
			<p class="text"> Bioprinting is a novel form of 3D printing, where a printer extrudes bioink to form a scaffold for cells to grow in. Our lab partners with Dr. Kumta to create unique alginate scaffolds for islet culture. We study methods of bioprinting alginate in various configurations, allowing for optimal viability and alginate structure maintenance. We also study the mathematics behind alginate printing on membranes in order to develop accurate alginate structures.  </p>

		<!-- Vascularization -->
		<h3 class="headings_right"> Vascularization </h3>
		<div class="bios_single">
			<img src="img/lectin.jpg" alt="" class="image_single_right">
			<p class="text_right" style="padding-top: 30px;"> One of the prime roadblocks to advanced tissue engineering is nutrient transport. In the body, the dense vasculature of islets allows them to quickly respond to changes in nutrient concentrations at maximum capacity. When islets are isolated from the body, however, these capillaries collapse. This limits mass transport in the islet, cutting off the innermost cells from receiving adequate oxygen and glucose, and in turn preventing total insulin secretion. We engineer islets with new vasculature by re-aggregating them along with microvascular fragments and mesenchymal stem cells to recreate the islet vascular system. </p>
